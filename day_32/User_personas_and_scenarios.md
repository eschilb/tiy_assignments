#Veronica the Volunteer


Veronica is volunteering for an event in downtown Austin and will be bringing a foster dog that is available for adoption to the event. She needs to get the time, address, and contact information for the pickup from the foster home. She also needs to confirm the ride home information by being message the foster parents when she's on the way back to drop off the foster dog.


#Frank the Foster Parent


Frank has a foster dog that is due for a checkup and a round of shots for the younger dog that he's fostering. He needs to schedule the appointment in advance and check to see who is available to transport his foster dog to the appointment and who is available to transport the foster dog back home. Then he can book his appointment at the appropriate time so that the schedule is set.

#Sam the Shelter Coordinator

Sam needs to make sure that all the foster dogs have scheduled transportation to and from an adoption event this weekend. She needs to see a list of the foster parents and their dogs, and the available volunteers and the volunteers that are scheduled for pickups/dropoffs already. It's good to know how many available volunteers she has for any unplanned visits to the clinic that take place.

#Veronica the Volunteer

Veronica is a retired empty nester who volunteers at the animal shelter with all the spare time that she has. She needs a way to communicate with foster parents to get pickup/drop-off times/info so she she can take them to scheduled events, routine clinic visits, and unscheduled clinic visits when she's available to transport. She is familiar with app technologies, but needs something easy to use to keep her schedule organized.


#Frank the Foster Parent

Frank is in his 20s, unmarried with no kids, and loves furry friends and giving back to the community. He is currently fostering a dog that needs to attend adoption events to find a forever home. His foster dog also needs to have routine visits at the animal shelter. Frank doesn't have time to take him to every event and routine visit so he has to arrange transport to get his foster to and from.


#Sam the Shelter Coordinator

Sam, in her 30s, is animal lover that works at the animal shelter coordinates volunteers and foster parents. She is dedicated to the cause and needs a convenient way to communicate with both foster parents and volunteers and have all of the logistics/scheduling for transportation of foster pets in one location.
