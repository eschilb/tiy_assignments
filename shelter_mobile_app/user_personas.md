#Veronica the Volunteer


Veronica is volunteering for an event in downtown Austin and will be bringing a foster dog that is available for adoption to the event. She needs to get the time, address, and contact information for the pickup from the foster home. She also needs to confirm the ride home information by being message the foster parents when she's on the way back to drop off the foster dog.


#Frank the Foster Parent


Frank has a foster dog that is due for a checkup and a round of shots for the younger dog that he's fostering. He needs to schedule the appointment in advance and check to see who is available to transport his foster dog to the appointment and who is available to transport the foster dog back home. Then he can book his appointment at the appropriate time so that the schedule is set.

#Sam the Shelter Coordinator

Sam needs to make sure that all the foster dogs have scheduled transportation to and from an adoption event this weekend. She needs to see a list of the foster parents and their dogs, and the available volunteers and the volunteers that are scheduled for pickups/dropoffs already. It's good to know how many available volunteers she has for any unplanned visits to the clinic that take place.
