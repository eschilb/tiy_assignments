# Blogolicious Post Week 1 and 2

Hey, everybody! 

It's my first blog post while taking the UI Design Course at The Iron Yard - Austin. I'm sure everyone has been having unique experiences while at The Iron Yard and I'm happy to express what's been going on in my world so far! The first week has been all HTML and CSS. Our weekend project has been to build a blog website for a hipster named Lennon Miles using what we have learned so far with HTML and CSS. My favorite part has been to go back over the code this week and use SCSS for nesting, variables, and partials. Deleting any instances where repeating myself in the code has been a cathartic experience. I initially felt frustrated by the code that I wrote because it looked messy to me. Luckily, it feels more like I have a grasp on what organized and clean code looks like.


One thing that I was surprised by is how many moments that I would have where ideas "click." Some moments, I won't even be coding but I have a thought about it...this makes me wonder if I'll wake up from coding dreams long after this course is over. I mean, this course is just my first step into a new field.


Last week was also great for Austin because Google announced that they are testing their self-driving cars here in Austin. This is the first state outside of California that is testing the cars. I went to an event at The Thinkery where they showed off the cars. It's such a cool time to be a part of the tech community in Austin. I look forward to all of the networking events and to be more involved with the tech community. So far, anyone that I've talked to about taking the UI Design course has been so supportive and had questions about what it's been like in a bootcamp style course. I really appreciate my friends and family in these moments for understanding their role that they play in keeping me sane and making sure things have been going okay so far.


So far, this experience has definitely been worth it and I can't wait to see how things progress from week to week.
