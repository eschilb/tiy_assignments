		<p class="par2">A bit about me...
		<br><br>I've been in Austin, TX since February 2014. I'm originally from South Carolina and I have a BS in Psychology from College of Charleston. When I'm not at The Iron Yard, I like exploring new things in Austin, hiking, swimming, and going to music festivals.
		</p>
		<p class="par2">Music festivals attended since Austinized...
		<br><br>SXSW, Free Press Music Fest, Utopiafest, Art Outside, ACL, Fun Fun Fun Fest, Float Fest, Freezerburn, and Head for the Hills	
		</p>
		<p class="par2">Accomplishments in food...
		<br><br>I've probably eaten at least 100 tacos while in Austin. But that's nothing compared to <a href="http://fedmanwalking.com/">this guy</a>. Some of my favorites include El Chilito, Taco-Mex, Taco More, Torchy's, Tacodeli, and Veracruz. I've also eaten my weight in pho. I love Pho Saigon and Elizabeth Street Cafe.
