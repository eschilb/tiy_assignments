    This weekend was a project to redesign the CSS Zen Garden website with a theme based on our assigned art movement. I was given Pop Art and the idea is to use the same HTML file from the original website and only use CSS to showcase our web design skills. 
    
    I was really excited to do the Pop Art movement and struggled to pick a direction for the site. There are so many famous artists and sculptors from this movement and I think it's often redone in modern design. I had to strike a balance between looking dated and looking modern. We were asked to push the envelope of what we know and I pushed it. There were two recurring thoughts that I had while designing and coding this site: 'I have no idea what I'm doing," and "I'm so brilliant for figuring out this thing I didn't know how to do before."
    
    I gave myself an extreme migraine after looking at the same primary color palette almost all day. I had to stop looking at all screens and snooze through a few hours of Sunday evening with an ice pack on my face to get back to a feeling like a functioning person again. Then, I was back at it to try to add to the site with things that I hadn't been able to figure out yet. I read a lot of articles to figure out some issues so thank you Internet for saving my hiney again. 
    
    So what did I learn so far? I'm not giving myself enough credit for the skills I have at this point and I'm way too hard on myself for any shortcomings. I also need to be careful when comparing myself to fellow designers. I don't come from an art, graphic design, or print design background so I have been winging it on the design part. I don't come from a computer science background so being able to code a website at all is an accomplishment. Not to make my story the one of the underdog, but I have to say it's kind of amazing what I've done so far. And it's kind of amazing what I'll be doing next.
    
    This week, I'll be attempting to blog every day leading up to the hackathon. I want to cover topics about me because it's important to get my story out there and also what I'm learning at The Iron Yard. I probably won't blog during the hackathon and will wait until afterwards to write a reaction like I did for the CSS Zen Garden Redesign.
