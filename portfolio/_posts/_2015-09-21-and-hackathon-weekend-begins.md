Today we showed off the CSS Zen Garden websites and received feedback. We also were reviewed for week 3 and 4 of class and it went well considering that I started from square one at the beginning of the course. It's great to feel how far I've come, but I know that there is work to do. 

When we talk about defending our decisions, I think about experiences in the past where I was asked to do projects and go through them with leadership to review. Even if my projects weren't done the way that management had envisioned, they appreciated that I always had a reason for the decisions that I made during the project. That experience has helped me a lot in defending design decisions and trying to articulate my opinions in design critiques.
