I'm done with the hackathon and I'm happy I got through it. We got our groups and requirements on Thursday. I went out to lunch with my team and we decided to do a web application that reserves a parking spot at a restaurant so you don't have to drive around looking for parking. A lot of time and gas is spent driving around looking for parking so a solution in the future would be for spots to be reserved before they arrive at their destination.

I spent Thursday doing sketches of the site and finding inspiration sites. Friday I worked on style tiles and mockups. The weekend was spent coding the website and we presented first thing Monday morning. Every day felt like I was in a time suck where every time I looked up from work two hours had passed. 

I learned a lot this weekend by working on a team with a backend developer and two frontend developers. We all acted as the expert in our field and had to communicate what we could do and how our piece of the project would interact with theirs. The point was also to show that as a UI Designer I won't be working in a bubble and I'll be working with developers in a real world job.
