# Internal Anaylsis

What we do right...

- can discuss books with friends like a social network for people that read
- can write reviews and ratings for self and others
- can read a feed of friend activity
- can separate books by what you want to read, what you are reading, and what you have read
- can explore popular books in different topics
- gives the feel of having a friendlier crowd than the average social network
